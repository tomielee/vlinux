# # # CREATE
docker build --rm -t <IMAGENAME>:<TAG> .
    # added -rm to remove all the <none> so no more need to prune if not neccery.
    # don't forget the . if you're in the directory where the dockerfile is.

# # # RUN containter
docker run --rm -d --net <NETWORKNAME> -p 8083:80
    # apache runs on 80 local
    # when running in bash use -d detached. The server is then running in the background - so you don't need a new terminal window. Check container with ps -a

# # # RM IMAGE
docker image rm IMAGENAME


# # # NOTES
Create files in your script. Copy only your script.
Create diretories if these are needed for your script.
