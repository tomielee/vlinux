<h1>Lab 3 - vlinux</h1>
<p>A lab where you use Unix tools available from the command line interface to manipulate a textfile. Have a look at https://regex101.com/. It is a good tool when trying out regular expressions.</p>


<h2>1. Sed</h2>
<p>Work with the command <code>sed</code> to parse/match text from files. This lab is constructed for GNU/sed. Use <code>man sed</code> as reference.</p>

<p>To answer the questions, use the following structure:
<code>ANSWER = $(sed &lt;flag&gt; '/regex/p' &lt; textfile.txt)</code></p>

<p>The relevant flags are <code>-E</code> (Extended) and <code>-n</code> (just print the matching lines)</p>


<h3>Exercise 1.1 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Use the <code>sed</code> command and match <code>192.168.0.1</code> from the file <code>numbers.txt</code>. The content of the file is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>192.168.0.1<br />
  192-168-0-1<br />
  19216801<br />
  19.21.68.01<br />
  192.168.0-1<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.2 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Use the <code>sed</code> command and match all lines starting with the word <code>The</code> in the file <code>quotes.txt</code>. The content of the file is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day.<br />
  The best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time.<br />
  The only mystery in life is why the kamikaze pilots wore helmets.<br />
  I don’t believe in astrology; I’m a Sagittarius and we’re skeptical.<br />
  My opinions may have changed, but not the fact that I’m right.<br />
  A bank is a place that will lend you money if you can prove that you don’t need it.<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.3 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Use the <code>sed</code> command and match all lines containing a lowercased, two lettered word followed by a space and a word starting with a lowercase <code>a</code> in the file <code>quotes.txt</code>. The content of the file is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day.<br />
  The best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time.<br />
  The only mystery in life is why the kamikaze pilots wore helmets.<br />
  I don’t believe in astrology; I’m a Sagittarius and we’re skeptical.<br />
  My opinions may have changed, but not the fact that I’m right.<br />
  A bank is a place that will lend you money if you can prove that you don’t need it.<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.4 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Use the <code>sed</code> command and match all lines having an <code>e</code> in the last word in the file <code>quotes.txt</code>. The content of the file is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day.<br />
  The best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time.<br />
  The only mystery in life is why the kamikaze pilots wore helmets.<br />
  I don’t believe in astrology; I’m a Sagittarius and we’re skeptical.<br />
  My opinions may have changed, but not the fact that I’m right.<br />
  A bank is a place that will lend you money if you can prove that you don’t need it.<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.5 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Use the <code>sed</code> command and match all valid emails in the file <code>emails.txt</code>. Use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Syntax to see which are valid. The content of the file is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>fake@somewhere.c0m<br />
  another_fake23@city.se<br />
  programmer@dbwebb.se<br />
  fiSHy_AT_computer.net<br />
  mobile@phone.s<br />
  username@website.com<br />
  1a2b3c@456.com<br />
  someone@temp@stuff<br />
  &#8221; &#8220;@example.org<br />
  here.is.an.email@address.org<br />
  a@b.c<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>2. Capturing groups and substitution</h2>
<p>Practise on working with grouping and substitution. The structure of a command may look like:
<code>$(sed -E 's/&lt;match&gt;/&lt;substitution&gt;/g')</code>.</p>


<h3>Exercise 2.1 (1 points)</h3>
<p>You will use the file <code>substitution.txt</code>. Thor is feeling stronger so help him to change the username to <code>MightyThor</code> in the file.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.2 (1 points)</h3>
<p>You will use the file <code>substitution.txt</code>. Thor is not mighty anymore, but he want to change <code>home</code> to <code>Asgaard</code>. Help him do that.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.3 (1 points)</h3>
<p>You will use the file <code>substitution.txt</code>. Help Thor to combine the two former questions.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.4 (1 points)</h3>
<p>You will use the file <code>substitution.txt</code>. Thor got a picture that he wants to put in the family folder. Create a new entry under <code>/home/Thor/Pictures/Family/</code> where Thor gets his own folder containing a picture, called <code>selfie.png</code>.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.5 (1 points)</h3>
<p>You will use the logfile <code>access-medium.log</code>. Use sed to get the year, month and day from each line in the log. Present the result in the format: <code>YYYY-Mmm-dd</code>, for example 2019-May-18.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.6 (1 points)</h3>
<p>You will use the logfile <code>access-medium.log</code>. Use sed to get only the ip-addresses from each line where the first digit is between 4 and 6 (4 and 6 included).</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>







<h2>3. Extra assignments</h2>
<p>Solve these optional questions to earn extra points. You might want to look at more flags and options for the sed command.</p>


<h3>Exercise 3.1 (3 points)</h3>
<p>You will use the logfile <code>access-medium.log</code>. Use sed to get all URL&#8217;s (the domain) from the file. Do not match URL&#8217;s with only uppercase.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>
