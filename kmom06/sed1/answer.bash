# Lab 3 - vlinux 
# 
# A lab where you use Unix tools available from the command line interface to
# manipulate a textfile. Have a look at https://regex101.com/. It is a good
# tool when trying out regular expressions.
#

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Section 1. Sed 
# 
# Work with the command `sed` to parse/match text from files. This lab is
# constructed for GNU/sed. Use `man sed` as reference.
#
# To answer the questions, use the following structure:
# `ANSWER = $(sed <flag> '/regex/p' < textfile.txt)`
#
# The relevant flags are `-E` (Extended) and `-n` (just print the matching
# lines)
#

#"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
# Exercise 1.1 (1 points) 
# 
# Use the `sed` command and match `192.168.0.1` from the file `numbers.txt`.
# The content of the file is:
#
# > 192.168.0.1<br />
# 192-168-0-1<br />
# 19216801<br />
# 19.21.68.01<br />
# 192.168.0-1<br />
#
#
# Answer with the result.
#
# Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
